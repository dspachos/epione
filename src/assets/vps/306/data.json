The most prominent NSAIDs are aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen, all available over the counter in most countries.

Research shows that some of the best ways to improve your life is to help you live with your pain instead of masking it. When you accept your pain, you change how you experience pain and begin the process of reducing it. There are many activities you can do to help manage your pain. These activities aim to support overall self-care and lower your stress levels such as exercise, breathing techniques, progressive muscle relaxation, guided imagery, mindfulness, journaling, social activities with family and friends. This procedure of course takes time to build up and does not happen over night.
