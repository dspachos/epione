She is 55 years old and has been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis 9 years ago. She has mild deformities in her fingers due to the inflammation in her fingers and from the past year until now she is experiencing severe discomfort in both her knees. Although she receives medication, the pain is sometimes acute in nature, making it very difficult for her to carry through simple tasks and daily activities. Her doctor advised her to try to reduce her weight so that her knees are less stressed and also suggested her to attend physiotherapy sessions under guidance. She decided to follow her doctor's advice.",
